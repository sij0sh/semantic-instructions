# Architecture

Status: draft, inferred

Reverse-engineered from `SKILL.md`, `references/details.md`, and `scripts/semantic_flow.py`. Confirm before treating as authoritative.

## Purpose

An agent skill that authoring-routes instruction changes through three phases: Frame (read before writing), Compose (smallest sufficient instruction), Challenge (evidence of failure and necessity). The engine stores workflow state and prints prompts; it never writes the target instruction.

## Components

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SK[SKILL.md] --> DET[references/details.md]
    SK --> ENG[scripts/semantic_flow.py]
    PR[references/principles.md] -. guidance .-> SK
    ENG <-->|validated JSON, flock| STATE[(.agents/semantic-instructions.json)]
    ENG --> PROMPT[Phase prompt + output contract]
    PROMPT --> AGENT[Calling agent]
    AGENT -->|JSON result| ENG
    AGENT --> TARGET[Target file or inline text]
    ENG -. never writes .-> TARGET
```

## Phase state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> frame
    frame --> compose: frame result
    compose --> challenge: candidate
    challenge --> compose: revise (passes < 2)
    challenge --> complete: pass
    challenge --> complete: revise (passes = 2, unresolved risk)
    complete --> [*]
```

- Each phase owns a rotating ticket; a stale or duplicate ticket is rejected.
- `frame` records a target fingerprint; `challenge` rejects if the target changed first.
- State schema is validated on every read and write.
- Writes use a temp file, fsync, and atomic replace under an exclusive `flock` (5 s timeout).

## Invariants

- The engine writes only its own state, never the target.
- A review operation never writes.
- Revision is capped at two passes; residual defects are reported as unresolved risks.
- State and artifacts live under `.agents/`, which is gitignored.
